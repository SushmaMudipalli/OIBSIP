        Mother Teresa (26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), also known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was an Albanian-Indian Roman
        Catholic nun and missionary. Although her passport name was Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, she was born Anjezë Gonxhe 
        Bojaxhiu (Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]), in Üsküb[a]—now Skopje, capital of North Macedonia. After living in
        Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived for most of her life.
        In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation that had over 4,500
        nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS,
        leprosy and tuberculosis. It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling
        programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, and also 
        profess a fourth vow – to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."She was the youngest child of Nikollë 
        and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai). Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died 
        in 1919 when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however,his family was from Mirdita(present
        -day Albania). Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova. According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë
        was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by 
        age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life. Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as 
        she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages. She arrived in India
        in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's
        School near her convent. She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux,
        the patron saint of missionaries; because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish
        spelling of Teresa.

    <h4 class="award">From the Indian government, Mother Teresa received the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for

        Bharat Ratna (India's highest civilian award) in 1980. Mother Teresa's official biography, by Navin Chawla, was published 
        in 1992. In Calcutta, she is worshipped as a deity by some Hindus.To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the
        government of India issued a special ₹5 coin (the amount of money Mother Teresa had when she arrived in India) on
        28 August 2010. Mother Teresa received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, given for work
        in South or East Asia, in 1962. In 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle
        to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace"</h4>
